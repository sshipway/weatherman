Weatherman 3.5 alpha

This is an editor for the weathermap program config files.  Currently, it only
works well if you have MRTG as your monitoring tool, not Cacti.  It should
work with mrtg-rrd or 14all but works best with routers2.

To install:
1. Install helper.cgi on your weathermap/MRTG server.
2. Give your web service write permission to the weathermap configs directory,
   and also to the icons and images directories, and read permission to the
   MRTG .cfg files.  
3. (Optional) add web server security to helper.cgi (username/password or IP
   address restrictions).  If you do this you will need to edit the weatherman
   script later.
4. Edit the helper.cgi to define the various paths and file locations. 
   CFGSUBDIRS should be blank if you do not use different subdirs from the
   cfgpath for your .cfg files, else set it to '*'.
5. Install Activeperl 5.8 or later on your workstation
6. Install weatherman.pl on your workstation
7. Edit weatherman.pl to give the URL of the helper.cgi script.  If you set a
   uername.password in (3) then also specify it here.
8. Run weatherman.pl and it should be able to find your helper script, so
   try using it!
